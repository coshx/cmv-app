#Full Stack JavaScript (FSJ) for the CMV

##Introduction
The [Configurable Map Viewer (CMV)](http://cmv.io/) is a community-supported open source mapping framework. CMV works with the [Esri JavaScript API](http://docs.cmv.io/en/latest/developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/), [ArcGIS Server](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver), and [ArcGIS Online](https://arcgis.com/). Full Stack Javascript (FSJ) for the CMV provides a proxy-enabled Node.js backend to streamline CMV widget development and deployment.

##Why Do This?
A [reverse proxy](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html) is needed for most production deployments. Currently, ESRI supplies [proxy configurations](https://github.com/Esri/resource-proxy) for .Net, Java, and PHP servers. For those desiring backend JavaScript in Node.js, FSJ for the CMV is your one stop shop for development and deployment.

##Getting Started
This project is still underdevelopment. By the time you're done playing around with the [CMV Map Viewer](http://demo.cmv.io/viewer/), maybe it'll be up and running!

## Documentation:
For now, refer to the [CMV documentation](http://docs.cmv.io/) for getting started and the [ESRI proxy configuration](https://github.com/Esri/resource-proxy) for setting up a proxy.
